To prepare your single, on-premises NetQ Appliance:

Inside the box that was shipped to you, you'll find:

- Your Cumulus NetQ Appliance (a Supermicro 6019P-WTR server)
- Hardware accessories, such as power cables and rack mounting gear (note that network cables and optics ship separately)
- Information regarding your order

For more detail about hardware specifications (including LED layouts and FRUs like the power supply or fans, and accessories like included cables) or safety and environmental information, refer to the {{<exlink url="https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/superserver/1U/MNL-1943.pdf" text="user manual">}} and {{<exlink url="https://www.supermicro.com/QuickRefs/superserver/1U/QRG-1943.pdf" text="quick reference guide">}}.

#### Install the Appliance

{{<netq-install/appliance-setup deployment="onprem">}}

#### Configure the Password, Hostname and IP Address

Change the password using the `passwd` command:

```
cumulus@hostname:~$ passwd
Changing password for <user>.
(current) UNIX password:
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
```

By default, DHCP is used to acquire the hostname and IP address. However, you can manually specify the hostname with the following command:

```
cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <newHostNameHere>
```

You can also configure these items using the Ubuntu Netplan configuration tool. For example, to set your network interface *eth0* to a static IP address of *192.168.1.222* with gateway *192.168.1.1* and DNS server as *8.8.8.8* and *8.8.4.4*:

Edit the */etc/netplan/01-ethernet.yaml* Netplan configuration file.

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# For more information, see netplan(5).
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        eno0:
            dhcp4: no
            addresses: [192.168.1.222/24]
            gateway4: 192.168.1.1
            nameservers:
                addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]
```

Apply the settings.

```
cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo netplan apply
```

{{%notice info%}}
If you have changed the IP address or hostname of the NetQ Appliance, you need to re-register this address with the Kubernetes containers before you can continue.

1. Reset all Kubernetes administrative settings. Run the command twice to make sure all directories and files have been reset.

    ```
    cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo kubeadm reset -f
    ```  

2. Remove the Kubernetes configuration. 

    ```
    cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo rm /home/cumulus/.kube/config
    ```

3. Reset the NetQ Platform install daemon.

    ```
    cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo systemctl reset-failed
    ```  

4. Reset the Kubernetes service. 

    ```
    cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo systemctl restart cts-kubectl-config
    ```  

    **Note**: Allow 15 minutes for the prompt to return.

#### Verify NetQ Software and Appliance Readiness

Now that the appliance is up and running, verify that the software is available and the appliance is ready for installation.

1. Verify that the needed packages are present and of the correct release, version 2.4.1 and update 26 or later.

    {{<netq-install/verify-pkgs>}}

2. Verify the installation images are present and of the correct release, version 2.4.1.

    {{<netq-install/verify-image deployment="onprem">}}

3. Run the following commands to prevent daily upgrades and Message of the Day news.

    ```
    cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo systemctl disable apt-{daily,daily-upgrade}.{service,timer}
    cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo systemctl stop apt-{daily,daily-upgrade}.{service,timer}
    cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo systemctl disable motd-news.{service,timer}
    cumulus@hostname:~$ sudo systemctl stop motd-news.{service,timer}
    ```

4. Verify the appliance is ready for installation. Fix any errors indicated before installing the NetQ software.

    {{<netq-install/verify-cmd deployment="onprem">}}

5. Run the Bootstrap CLI. Be sure to replace the *eth0* interface used in this example with the interface on the server used to listen for NetQ Agents.

    {{<netq-install/bootstrap server="single">}}

The final step is to install and activate the Cumulus NetQ software.  You can do this using the Admin UI or the CLI.
